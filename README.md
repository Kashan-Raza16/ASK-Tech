## Animation Properties
The animations share several common properties:
- **`y`**: Controls vertical movement.
- **`x`**: Controls horizontal movement.
- **`duration`**: Specifies the length of the animation in seconds.
- **`ease`**: Determines the animation's speed curve, influencing its flow.
- **`scrollTrigger`**: Configures how the animation is triggered by scrolling:
  - **`trigger`**: The element that initiates the animation.
  - **`start`**: Defines the scroll position where the animation begins, relative to the trigger and the viewport.
  - **`end`**: Defines the scroll position where the animation concludes.
  - **`scrub`**: Links the animation's progress directly to the scroll position. A value of `2`, for example, means the animation will follow the scroll by a 2-second delay.
